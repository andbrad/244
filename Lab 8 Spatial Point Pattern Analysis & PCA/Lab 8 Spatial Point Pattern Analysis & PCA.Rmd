###Column Graph of Texas Oil Spills

```{r}

 oil_spills <- read_csv("oil_spills.csv")

df <- oil_spills %>% 
  filter(`Accident State` == "TX" & `Accident Year` < 2017) %>%  #Use the '' quotations to add in a item with a space in the name. 
  group_by(`Accident Year`) %>% #These headings are not data science friendly, it would be better to have a metadata file that has a description based on a shorter header.
  summarise(Loss = sum (`Net Loss (Barrels)`))

colnames(df) <- c("Year", "Loss")

ggplot(df, aes(x = Year, y = Loss)) + 
  geom_col()
