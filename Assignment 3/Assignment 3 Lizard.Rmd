```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

#Load the cleaned .csv file.
lizard <- read_csv("lizard.csv")
```

```{r}

#Replace all the "." with NA, which R can handle better.

lizard[lizard =="."]<-NA

#Filter for adult lizards only.
m <- lizard %>% 
  filter(sex == "M" & site == "CALI")
f <- lizard %>% 
  filter(sex == "F"& site == "CALI")

m$weight <- as.numeric(m$weight)
f$weight <- as.numeric(f$weight)

```

```{r}



par(mfrow = c (2,2))
hist(m$weight)
hist(f$weight)
qqnorm(m$weight)
qqnorm(f$weight)

```

```{r}

f_test <- var.test(m$weight,f$weight)
f_test

```
Ther variances are equal, thus I will use student's t-test.

```{r}

t.test_diff <- t.test(m$weight, f$weight, var.equal = TRUE)
t.test_diff

```
No significant difference in weight between adult male and female lizards.
